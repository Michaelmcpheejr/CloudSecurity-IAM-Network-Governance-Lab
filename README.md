Cloud Security IAM & Network Governance Lab (Azure)

Author: Michael McPhee
Focus Areas: IAM Hardening • RBAC Governance • Network Segmentation • Storage Security • Activity Logging • Compliance Mapping

Overview:

This project demonstrates a fully zero-cost cloud security environment built in Microsoft Azure. The lab focuses on implementing identity governance, least privilege RBAC, network segmentation, and storage security using Azure-native tools and best practices aligned with NIST SP 800-53 and PCI DSS segmentation controls.

Key Objectives:

Deploy a secure Azure environment with proper segmentation

Implement RBAC at resource group, resource, and subnet level

Enforce least privilege through scoped role assignments

Secure Azure Storage with private access and granular data roles

Analyze Azure Activity Logs to validate access and configuration changes

Review Defender for Cloud baseline recommendations

Produce audit-ready documentation and remediation steps

Skills Demonstrated:

Azure IAM & RBAC

Subnet-level micro-segmentation

Principle of Least Privilege

Cloud governance & compliance mapping

Storage security hardening

Logging & monitoring

Audit report writing
